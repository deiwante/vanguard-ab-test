clnt_tenure_yr: Client's tenure with Vanguard in years.
clnt_tenure_mnth: Client's tenure with Vanguard in months.
clnt_age: Age of the client.
gendr: Gender of the client.
num_accts: Number of accounts the client holds with Vanguard.
bal: Total balance spread across all client accounts.
calls_6_mnth: Number of times the client reached out over a call in the past six months.

Introduction:
This project analyzes client behavior data from Vanguard's online process, aiming to understand the impact of a redesign. The documentation covers data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and hypothesis testing.

EDA & Data Cleaning:
Merged multiple datasets.
Standardized column names.
Cleaned missing values and data inconsistencies.
Created visualizations for data exploration.
Client Behavior Analysis:
Analyzed primary client demographics and behavior.
Explored client account holdings and balances.
Investigated completion rates and errors in the online process.
Performance Metrics:
Calculated completion rates for the control and test groups.
Analyzed time spent on each step of the online process.
Evaluated error rates, including backward movements.
Redesign Outcome:
Compared new design performance against the old one.
Reviewed completion rates, time per step, and errors.
Hypothesis Testing:
Conducted hypothesis tests on completion rates.
Assessed completion rate changes with a cost-effectiveness threshold.
Design Effectiveness:
Evaluated experiment structure, randomization, and biases.
Assessed the adequacy of the experiment timeframe.
Identified potential additional data needs.
Conclusion:
The analysis provides insights into the impact of the online process redesign on client behavior and completion rates. Further experimentation or data collection may enhance the analysis.
